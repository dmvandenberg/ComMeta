# ComMeta
ComMeta is a program usable for analyzing metagenome-derived genomes with a comparative approach. It provides statistics such as the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and the Average Amino acid Identity (AAI) as well as a Reciprocal Best Hit analysis and core- and variable genome analysis. To do the analyses various published tools have been used (listed below).
